ðŸ”¹ Workflow
Upload PDFs â†’ The system loads and splits PDF text into chunks.
Create Embeddings â†’ Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using Google Gemini Embeddings.
Store in FAISS â†’ The vectors are indexed for fast similarity search.
User Queries â†’ User inputs a question in Streamlit.
Retrieve Relevant Context â†’ FAISS searches for the most relevant document segments.
Generate Answer â†’ The retrieved context is fed into Groq's Gemma-2 9B IT model to generate a response.
Display Response â†’ The answer and relevant document excerpts are displayed.
